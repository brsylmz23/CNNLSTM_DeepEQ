## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains an implementation of a **CNN-LSTM model** designed for seismic signal processing. It includes scripts for **data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and signal processing**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Experiment Folders  

### ðŸŸ¢ `CNNLSTM_Pwave/`  
- This experiment adjusts seismic signals **around the P-wave arrival**.  

### ðŸ”µ `CNNLSTM_SP_EQT/`  
- Uses **P-wave arrival time** as additional input information.  
- **EQT dataset** is used for **both training and testing**.   

### ðŸŸ  `CNNLSTM_SP_stTEST/`  
- Similar to `CNNLSTM_SP_EQT/`, but uses **manually labeled** seismic data as the **test set**.  

### ðŸ”´ `CNNLSTM_TRANSFER/`  
- Implements **transfer learning** by using **pretrained weights** from previous experiments.
